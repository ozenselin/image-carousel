# Image Carousel

A clean and responsive image carousel that displays a series of images with smooth scaling transitions and a subtle sense of depth. Ideal for simple galleries, product showcases, or any use case where a lightweight, distraction-free image slider is needed.

The carousel offers basic configuration options including custom class names, scaling behavior, and image sourcesâ€”making it easy to adapt visually without introducing complexity.

## Live Demo

The GIF here demonstrates the basic functionality, but the actual carousel transitions are smoother and more fluid.

Note that the carousel also supports **left and right arrow keys**, as well as **indicator dots**, though this GIF shows navigation via the **Previous** and **Next** buttons for clearer visual demonstration.

## What You Can Configure
- Images: Pass your own image list (with src, alt, and width)
- CSS Classes: Customize class names for every element (panels, buttons, indicators)
- Scale Behavior: Adjust how much the focused image grows compared to the rest

## Installation

To install the carousel, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @ozenselin/image-carousel
```
